<h1 align='center'> Hello, I am Aman Chauhan </h1>  
I have created a complete e-commerce website using the React and It is a Static website:

Navigation Bar:

The video begins with the creation of a navigation bar, allowing users to navigate to different pages on the website.
Homepage:

The homepage features a hero element, creating a visually appealing introduction to the website.
Product Showcase:

Products popular in the "bman" category are highlighted on the homepage, providing users with quick access to popular items.
Exclusive Deals Banner:

An exclusive deals banner is showcased, where special offers or promotions can be displayed to attract customer attention.
New Collections:

The video covers the process of adding new products from an admin panel, and these new additions are dynamically displayed in the new collections section.
Newsletter Subscription Box:

A newsletter subscription box is implemented, allowing users to subscribe for updates, promotions, or newsletters.
Footer:

The video concludes with the creation of a footer containing links to various sections, providing additional information and navigation options.
Overall, the tutorial seems to cover the essential elements of an e-commerce website, including navigation, product display, promotions, and user engagement features like newsletter subscriptions. Viewers can expect to learn how to build these components using the M Stack technology.
 


#How to Run and Deploy a Project 
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
